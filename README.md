## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow automatically builds and deploys your site whenever you push to the `main` branch. No manual steps required!

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Push your code to the `main` branch on GitHub
2. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Select **`main`** branch and **`/ (root)`** folder
5. GitHub Actions will automatically run and deploy your site

The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### Local Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer to deploy manually from your local machine:
1. Run `npm run deploy` to build and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch
2. Configure GitHub Pages to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch in repository settings
